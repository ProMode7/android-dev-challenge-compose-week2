## :scroll: Description
A simple app that uses Jetpack components to create beautiful UI. This demo apps allows you to take small break to meditate and relax.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I usually take small breaks between my working hours to relax my eyes and back. The idea came from there. so I created this small app which sets a timer of 3 minutes.
This app also has the options to pause or restart the timer if needed. Another exciting thing from me was to add the cloud animations.
Design motivation from this dribble design:
